                             <p>“I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. You are passionate...I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?” </p>
							<p>A few months after I meet you again, I fall for you. I fight against it, but it is useless. Memories of you haunt me at every turn. I remember you showing me how to code. I remember you inspiring me to think out of the box. I remember you and me running around the house. I remember us playing with fire at the seaside. You had borrowed a lighter from someone to set fire to a pile of withered leaves. They wouldn’t burn so you found a piece of discarded tissue and set that on fire. It spread to the leaves and burned for a while. Before long, the fire went out. That was in spring. </p>
							<p>Every spring reminds me of you. I remember us cramming ourselves into the boot of a car for fun --- there were too many people in my family for your car. I remember us discussing math and parabolas. You never could make me like math as you did, though. You left my life as suddenly as you entered; we had only half a year together. You had moved countries three times by then and was probably used to changing friends, but I was not. The first year you went back we often called each other and passed many hours in understanding and laughter. We had the same sense of humor and the same frequency. You had a livelier mind than I did and I never felt as if I had to try very hard to make you understand. In a few hours, I felt like I knew you for years. We nearly never talked about our lives, preferring to discuss ideas, but I felt like we understood each other. I trust and hope that this was not one-sided.</p>
							<p>Then you went to boarding school. All our contact was cut off and I fell for you. Perhaps I was so starved for some intellectual conversation that my memory started idealizing our interactions. You opened my mind to ideas and I have not found anyone with whom I could do that yet. </p>
							<p>When you returned, you were different. You were much, much more polite, and kept apologizing for nothing. I would have preferred the frank and to-the-point person you were before. I still know that person is there, because sometimes in conversation you let it slip. Or rather, you cover it under lots of “in my opinion”s and “if I may say.” I’m sure that you learned that at the school. You also realized that your tone was often ironic, and still is, so you would often say, “I am not being sarcastic here even though it sounds so.” Sometimes when our parents called each other, we would also talk and it just gives me so much pleasure. We still didn’t talk about our lives, but that spark was there. By that time, I had put out my flame for you. The conversation stayed in my mind a few days, but I didn’t fall for you again. Until it was a prolonged absence. I don’t know if you don’t like me or you were taught that boys and girls don’t talk often, but from then you started to ignore me. You weren’t the best at answering messages in the first place, but you started to open my texts and never reply anything. And yet, I fall for you again. Now, I wouldn't really dare to call you or talk to you because I’m afraid of myself. I’m afraid of what I will say. This love will never amount to anything when there are these barriers between us. I hope that I will never go so far as to give up my principles for you; I hope that these barriers can be done away with.</p>
