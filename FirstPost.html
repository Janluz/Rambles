                              <p>Today is one of those days where I must write. I must get my thoughts on paper. It is a good thing that it is Saturday; often I need to stifle this feeling because I have no time. Actually, I have time, but when I do, I have more “important” things to do, such as studying or doing crochet. I get up at six A.M. in the morning but I often fail at it. Usually it becomes 6:30am or even later. I am somewhat lazy in the morning and my phone does not help that. My eyes are getting worse and I know that I need to do something about it. I get to school at 8:30 and am shut up in classes until noon. On the subway I work on my vocabulary and memorize words by rote. It gives me a sense of satisfaction but it does not come close to writing. I finish lunch at 2pm and do my homework. I am technically free after that but I make myself do math, logic, and extra homework. If I don’t, I won’t be able to stay on top of the class. Staying on top isn’t exactly my goal, because I started in the middle of the class, but it feels good to be close to the top. And scary because I know I would fall if I slack off. So it’s a two-edged sword. 
I should be working on my Turkish or answering emails, but I am frankly too tired. I need an outlet, and only writing would satisfy it. You say that answering emails would help, but it does not offer that sense of relief because I need to phrase my words just right, convey exactly the amount of feeling I want to, and not offend my reader. Here, I am free from judgement. I hide behind a false name and people getting offended is the least of my concerns. 
I grew up in Singapore, where my creativity was only allowed an outlet in piano. I hated drawing and nearly all things creative. I liked structure. I loved schedules. Until I came to Turkey. </p>
	<p>I moved to Turkey when I was thirteen and I am still here at eighteen. It has become more and more oppressive and so I look forward to the day I am moving to United States. I went back to China two years ago and it nearly broke me. I cried myself to sleep over half of the nights and moped around the rest of the time. If I walk in my community and do not pay attention to the signs, I feel as if I am back in China. I never felt that before. That feeling is getting to me and slowly stifling me. Whenever I close the window, I feel like I am a bird looking out of a cage. When I open the window, I feel like I am Winston in 1984. It was unbearable in China because I was plunged into it, but here it is slowly moving in. It feels like cooking a frog in warm water, and is ignorable at times. That’s why I have stopped going for walks, and turn to writing instead. This is one of the few mediums where I am anonymous and can have the freedom of speech. Oh, you don’t know what freedom is when you have not experienced deprivation! Imagine watching all your words carefully to avoid people saying that you implied something. It is slowly appearing in Europe and States too, but at least the people do not face court cases from the government. Their amendments still protect free speech, in a sense, and their government is not very concerned with what people say about them. In the East, however, free speech is often waved around like an empty word. Leaders, especially ones in China, want to protect their name by controlling how people think about them. Like they could. In the end, their turn people into hypocrites, which make me mad. My mother says I’m young so that’s why I am upset. And I am influenced by the American way of thought. 
I can name three books that affected my childhood years and highly influenced the way I thought. The Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett, Elsie Dinsmore by Martha Finley, and Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I have read thousands of books, but these remain closest to my heart. I am not sure where this post is going, but it will probably give you a better glimpse of me. Or the glimpse I want you to get. 
I read The Little Princess when I was seven, or even eight. I can’t remember. It taught me to be gentle to all, calm under all circumstances, and imagine a better world when things go wrong. Most of all, I adopted the idea that crying was weak-- “soldiers never cry,” as Sara would say. From Sara, I learned to be quiet and tone down my responses, to be quietly strong and selfless. I am not so sure about the selfless part, but I am a very quiet girl now. I need to learn to speak louder, as my teachers often remind me. The LIttle Princess imprinted the idea that imagination was a good thing and should be developed upon my mind. I still remember reading her telling Emergrade, her new friend, that dolls could walk and talk, and thinking that she was a funny child. Now, it is normal to me. I don’t see things, but I can imagine. Often, I can make them seem real, but never as real as Sara does. I have this book to thank for my imagination, and for my ability to write. Because I can imagine, I can write. I need to write every week, it has become like an obsession. But I believe that most artists have that sense of urgency, because I have asked around. The Little Princess molded me into a quietly artistic person I am today. That brings me to Elsie. 
Elsie Dinsmore taught me the treasure of the Bible and how to bear up under trials. In contrast to Sara, Elsie cries a lot. She, however, has a quiet strength in her that comes from God and stands very firm when her principles are challenged. From Elsie, I learned to be yielding when principles do not come into question and to not budge an inch when it comes. I, however, need to clear up my principles because they are somewhat rusty right now. Someday I will tell you mine and how I made them. I admired the way that Elsie could quote the Bible at will, and attempted to emulate her. I am still working towards it. Elsie, similar to Sara, is quiet and calm. Both of them are actually very pretty but they do not think so. This is somewhat unrelated, but these books gave me the impression that curly hair was pretty. I often need to remind myself that straight hair can be pretty too. Elsie Dinsmore held up a model girl that was quiet but strong girl, and I hope I am like that. Now we come to Jane Eyre.
Jane Eyre is a romance novel, and yes it is. I can identify with Jane to a T, which is why I like this book so much. I value the mind and the character. I don't really care about their demeanor, or at least I think so right now. We shall see. I am like Jane in the sense that I can be polite but it often discomfits me. In fact, it makes me feel as if I am walking on eggshells. Because of my upbringing, I also have that sense of shyness around guys. I do not like guys in the normal handsome sense, which usually means muscular and humorous. Jane Eyre has not lived with me long enough so I cannot tell you the future benefits.
So yeah, I am more English than I am Chinese. Or the American two hundred years ago. I do not enjoy the jokes Americans play on each other, or laughing at the pain of others. It’s terrible to laugh at other people’s failures. In the Bible, those who laugh at other people’s troubles will get the wrath of God upon their head. Imagine that. An Almighty God getting angry at you. You’re just a reed in His hand. He can break it in half without any effort. 
I would exactly say i am English either, because I have not met many English people and they seem too similar to Americans for me to tell the difference. They are just not as direct or as fun-loving as the Americans as far as I gathered. I don’t exactly know.
